Question 1740/1299: Is the CSF radiolucent or radioopaque?
Expected: Radiolucent
Received: The terms "radiolucent" and "radioopaque" are used to describe how substances appear on X-ray-based imaging, such as a CT scan or a plain radiograph, not on an MRI like the one shown. Therefore, a "yes" or "no" answer is not applicable to this image.

*   **Radiolucent** means the substance allows X-rays to pass through and appears dark (e.g., air).
*   **Radioopaque** means the substance blocks X-rays and appears white (e.g., bone).

This image is an MRI, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves. In MRI terminology, we use terms like **hypointense** (dark) and **hyperintense** (bright) to describe signal intensity. In this specific MRI sequence (likely a FLAIR image), the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the central ventricles has been made to appear dark, or **hypointense**.

Question 1019/1299: Is there enhancement of the lesion?
Expected: No
Received: No.

This appears to be a T2-weighted MRI scan. On this sequence, lesions with high water content (such as tumors, inflammation, or edema) naturally appear bright. The term "enhancement" specifically refers to the brightening of a lesion on a T1-weighted MRI scan after the intravenous injection of a contrast agent (like gadolinium). Since this is not a post-contrast T1-weighted image, enhancement cannot be evaluated from this picture.
