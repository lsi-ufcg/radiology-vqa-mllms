The presence of a contrast agent would have provided a more defined and detailed image of the pelvis, which is not the case in this image. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that no contrast was used in this image.

Question 96/227: Will medical therapy be enough?
Expected: Yes
Received: **Answer:** No

**Reasoning:**

* The question is asking if medical therapy will be enough to treat the condition.
* The provided image is an X-ray of a human body, which suggests that the question is related to a medical or health-related issue.
* The answer "No" is chosen because it is not clear from the image or the question itself that medical therapy would be sufficient to treat the condition. The X-ray may be showing a serious medical issue that requires more than just medical therapy, such as surgery or other medical interventions. Therefore, the answer "No" is chosen to indicate that medical therapy alone may not be enough to treat the condition.
