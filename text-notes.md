## Anotações

- Pode usar "nós" e voz passiva  
- Não é necessário usar citações no Resumo  
- Radiology is not just X-ray. While X-ray imaging is a part of radiology, the field encompasses a broader range of medical imaging techniques, including MRI, CT scans, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine, among others.
